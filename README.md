# Azure test

Code to run our first test in the [Azure plataform](https://azure.microsoft.com) for the project: "Prioritizing areas of the Atlantic Forest for ecological restoration using species geographic information and cost-benefit and land-use models". This project is coordinated by Marinez Ferreira de Siqueira and hosted at Rio de Janeiro Botanical Garden Research Institute (Instituto de Pesquisas Jardim Botânico do Rio de Janeiro - JBRJ). 

Here, we run ecological niche models in R using the [modleR package](https://github.com/Model-R/modleR) (Sánchez-Tapia et al 2017), developed by our team.
